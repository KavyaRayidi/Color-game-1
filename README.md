# Color-game
Game with 3, 6 or 9 offered colors to choose by looking at RGB collor that is given on top of page 

It would be nice to make a new option to... To choose do you want RGB or HEX values to play with.... 

The title in the game and on the screenshot is in Serbian language and means "Great game" - around RGB numbers and next to easy, medium and hard it means "New colors"....
